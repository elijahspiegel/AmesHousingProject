# Welcome to our Housing Price Project!

This project is based off of the Kaggle Competition, [Sale Price of Houses in Ames, Iowa](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stat101ahouseprice/overview)  
The data includes real estate data and housing prices for 2,578 homes in Ames, Iowa.  

### Objective

The goal of this project was to imagine we were a house flipper who wants to know what feature of a house would be most beneficial to renevate. In other words, which (renovatable) feature is most important in determing the worth of a house?

We built a random forest regression model that:  
1) accurately predicts housing prices  
2) ranks the importance of each house feature in determining the house price

### Work flow

We began this project with EDA, then feature engineering, then machine learning model building including multiple linear regression and random forest decision trees.  
This github provides the code for each of these steps.  
The final model we chose to use is the random forest model. Tree Model Exploration.ipynb includes this model and some exploration of the model's results.

### Results
